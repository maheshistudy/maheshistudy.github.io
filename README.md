# Second Life Studio ♻️

Welcome to **Second Life Studio** — a design activism campaign created as part of the _Design for Sustainability_ course at Victoria University of Wellington.

## 🌱 Project Purpose

The aim of this campaign is to promote **circular design practices** and reduce **material waste** within the School of Design Innovation by encouraging students to reuse and donate leftover materials.

## 💡 What's It About?

Design students often use a lot of materials like:
- Foam board
- Cardboard
- Fabric
- Acrylic
- Paper
- Electronic components

Many of these items go to waste at the end of term. Second Life Studio creates a **material swap zone** for students to donate what they don’t need and pick up what others have left behind.

## 🌐 Features

- 📥 Donate materials using the website form
- 🔍 Search reusable supplies in the shared space
- 📌 Display QR code in studio for easy access
- 🎨 Visually engaging and mobile-responsive design
- 🔄 Promotes sustainable, circular design practices
